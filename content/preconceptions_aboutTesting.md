In this article we tackle some prejudices that exist about software testing.
<!--more--> 
If we create a website, webshop, intranet, mine environment or other application, it must of course do exactly what we have agreed upon. In the article [Software testing methods: How we integrate them in our development cycle](softwaretesting_introduction.md) you can read how we ensure this. In this article we tackle some prejudices that exist about software testing.

# Misconception 1: testing is not that important
What if you decide not to test software? These three true stories give a nice indication of what can happen:

**Example 1**
> You have added functionality to your webshop. The new functionality works fine and the ordering process of your webshop is well organized. And yet your customers can suddenly order products for â‚¬ 0.-! Although you can legally cancel the purchase, it causes a lot of hassle and damage to your company image. Which you could have prevented with a functional test.

**Example 2**
> A company provides software for multiple choice tests. During the exam it appears that the exam candidates can see the correct answer in the HTML code. The exam results are invalid, the candidates duped and the damage to the company image is irreparable. A regression test could have prevented this debacle.

**Example 3**
> When Johan Cruijff died, several news sites were unable to cope with the enormous influx of website visitors. That cost them visitors and therefore lost advertising income. A performance or load test could have predicted this. This also applies to campaigns of web shops during large sales such as Black Friday.

# Misconception: We can do some quick testing at the end of the development cycle
Even when an organizations recognize the importance of testing, the time required for testing is often underestimated. For example, project managers estimate 95% of the available time for developing the software and 5% for testing. But testing takes more time than that. As a result, the delivery date is endangered. Often the date of the go-live is still maintained, which means that there is actually too little time left to properly test. That is why it is better to include testing in as part of the development process. 

# Misconception: you can easily do some testing yourself
There are numerous online test tools, and often they are free too. So why not do the testing yourself? To begin with, these tools usually offer very superficial tests. Moreover, you can only execute them after delivery. If you still encounter something, you have to go back into the development process. This causes delays, and that is why we have integrated the testing into our development process.

If we test the functionality and performance of an application, this is done by a trained and experienced tester. That way you know for sure that all important aspects and possible scenarios are covered.
